This is the source code for More Bookmarks Toolbar, 
a Firefox Extension by Marc Stober.

The actual source code of the extension is in the inner morebookmarkstoolbar
folder. A build script will zip the code into an XPI file structured 
for a Firefox Extension. Remember to `chmod +x build.sh` before running it.
(You could probably change the extension from `.sh` to 
`.bat` and run it on Windows, too, but I haven't tried that.)

The master file for the icon is in Pixelmator (Mac) format.
